### What is JavaScript

Javascript is computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

Of course what is a programming language?

  A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.

Reiterate the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (noun, adjective, verb)

  - 3 Ways to Access
    Chrome Menu (top right hamburger button) -> Tools -> Developer Tools
    Mac Shortcut: Cmd + Opt + i

  - Note the ways in which they can customize where there developer tools are located.

###Syntax
<a name="codealong1"></a>
When we talk about providing instructions to our computer in order to do so we need to speak their language. And the first step to doing that is to learn how that language operates.

####Numbers
- If you come from another programming language you may expect more than one data type to be associated with number values. In JavaScript there is only one data type that we refer to funnily enough as Numbers.

####Boolean
- The Boolean data type is a data type made up of only two values, intended to represent true and false.
