Exercise files for my Intro to JavaScript and jQuery workshop that I teach at General Assembly.

## Vocab

* **Javascript:** “is a dynamic computer programming language.” - Wikipedia
* **Variable:** "You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules." - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  * **Primitive:** "A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an Object and does not have any methods." - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
    * **Number:** A numeric data type. For example: Integers, Floats, Doubles, or Bignums. - [MDN Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number)
    * **String:** A sequence of characters. This literal is denoted with a single or double notation. - [MDN String Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String).
    * **Boolean:** A value used for logic that is converted to either true or false. - [MDN Boolean Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)
    * **Undefined:** A global variable that represents the value undefined. - [MDN Undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined)
* **Literals:** "You use literals to represent values in JavaScript. These are fixed values, not variables, that you literally provide in your script." - [MDN Values, Variables, and Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Values,_variables,_and_literals)
* **Operators:** symbols that can be used to assign values, compare values, preform arithmetic, test logic, manipulate strings, and more.
  * **Arithmetic operators:** "Arithmetic operators take numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and return a single numerical value." - [MDN Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Arithmetic_operators)
  * **Assignment operators:** "An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand." - [MDN Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Assignment_operators)
  * **String operators:** "In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings." - [MDN Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#String_operators)
  * **Comparison operators:** "compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true." [MDN Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Comparison_operators)
* **Function:** "A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)." - W3Schools
  * **Invoke:** To initiate a block of code, that would otherwise not be executed.
  * **Parameter:** A variable that is passed to a function and can be accessed inside the function's block of code.
* **Object (layman’s terms):** While a variable is a symbol for one specific values, and object is a symbol for a wrapper, that can have many values that describe it. - [MDN Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) - [MDN Object initializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer)
* **jQuery:** is a JavaScript library, or a collection of functions/methods and objects that you can utilize. “It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.” - [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** “A content delivery network or content distribution network (CDN) is a large distributed system of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the Internet. The goal of a CDN is to serve content to end-users with high availability and high performance.” - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)
* **MDN:** Mozilla Developer Network
